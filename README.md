# This application is not done yet.

## Main purpose:
This is going to be a kind of notes-list App. More advanced toDo-list , so to speak.

Its purpose is to make possible quickly write some shopping list on your PC (when you are home, and its faster than putting every letter on mobile-screen)
and open it (still with edit possibility, ofc) on your mobile phone, when you are outside.

### features: 
- Every note has a header and description, which you can easily edit (double click on note).
- Notes can be nested, one in another (As a imitation of subtasks / subnotes).
- Browser remembers notes untill deleting them: 
- - even after page reload,
- - even after closing-and reopening tab or entire browser,
- - even after device reboot.
- Notes menagement:
- - Changing check-status (visualised as crossing out note`s content).
- - Notes can change their position relative to each other (cut/paste mechanism).
