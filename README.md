## Nestable notes manager
This is another notes-list App. Kind of more advanced ToDo-list, so to speak. With some upgrades (listed below) :


### features: 
- Every note has a header and description, which you can easily edit (double click on note).
- Notes can be nested, one in another (As a imitation of subtasks / subnotes).
- Browser remembers notes untill deleting them: 
- - even after page reload,
- - even after closing-and reopening tab or entire browser,
- - even after device reboot.
- - (Doesn't work on private/incognito mode)
- Notes menagement:
- - Changing check-status (visualised as crossing out note`s content).
- - Notes can change their position relative to each other (cut/paste mechanism).
